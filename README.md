# Covid-19 Classifier

 Using an open source dataset to classify Covid-19 X-rays

 # Background

 COVID-19 attacks the cells that line our respiratory tract and we can use X-rays to analyze the health of our lungs. X-ray analysis requires valuable time, and the idea is that an automated classification system would save time and let the professionals spend their time with patients.

 # Dataset

 The data used was collected by [Dr. Joseph Cohen](https://josephpcohen.com/w/) and can be found [here](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset).
